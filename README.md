# Game Development Final Project

### About The Project

A shooting game set in a built-up area featuring camps and obstacles. There are two teams, each consisting of two players: the player's team and the enemy team. The objective is to search for weapons and grenades scattered throughout the area and use them to attack the opposing team. The game ends when one team loses both of its players, with the remaining team declared the winner.
